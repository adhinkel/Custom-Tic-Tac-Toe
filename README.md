# Custom Tic-Tac-Toe

### summary

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game in which the size of the board and the winning condition are supplied by the player.

The two rules can be changed in engine.h on lines 28 and 31.

The size of the window can also be changed freely in engine.h

### bugs

There are no known bug at time of submission.

### Future Work
This Project could be expanded to add a one-player mode in which player 2 is player by a computer. I could add multiple levels of difficulty for the automated opponent.

### Citations
All code for this project was written by me or the instructor

### Proposed Grade
#### Main Program
This project uses Module 4 concepts graphics framework, mouse input, multiple screens, and drawing.
It is interactive and all user input is correctly validated.

This program may seem simple at first but the complexity comes from making it work at all possible board sizes and win conditions.
Especially the Algorithm to check if a player has won the game was difficult to develop.
This project required me to apply a lot of math and made me appreciate the intersection between math and computer science.
Writing the code for this project took around 15 hours total.

I don't know what the threshold for "complex mathematical computations" is to recieve bonus points for complexity,
but I am quite proud of the algrithm I developed which determines if there are m objects in a row on an n x n grid of objects, given the index of one object.
#### User Experience
The program has multiple features to make it user friendly. For example, When you mouse over a square, it has an outline with the color of the player whose turn it is, allowing the players to always know whose turn it is if they lose track.
It also displays the win condition at the top of the screen while the game is being played, so that the user can't foget how many squares they are trying to connect.

#### Code Organization
Code is organized into folders where it makes sense

#### Style and Documentation
Comments are frequently present across the project. most notably to explain in detail how my algorithm works for win-checking, since I developed the algorithm while writing it and did not want to forget how it worked.
